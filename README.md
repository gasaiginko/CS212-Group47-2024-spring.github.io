### File structure: <br>
Main Page: index.html <br>
Traveller's Page: Travellers/index.html <br>
Student's Page: NAU/index.html <br>

For css/reference files, they are stored in the **same level** of folder with html file under ```styles```. e.x.: for ```/NAU/index.html```, its corresponding css file is stored at ```/NAU/styles/styles.css```. To check the file that html is using, you can also look for ```<link>``` element in the ```<head>``` section of html file. Similary, the static files such as images, docs, videos that are used in html are stored under same level of folder as ```styles.css``` (```./files/...png```).
